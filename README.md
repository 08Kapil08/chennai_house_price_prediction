# Data Cleaning:
- Filled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Replaced correct data type
- Removed outliers
- Corrected misspelled words

# EDA:
- plotted distribution of categorical features and numerical features
- plotted distribution of categorical features vs target and numerical features vs target
- After visualization done label and one hot Encoding

# Machine learning:
- Splitted the dataset for training and testing.

# Models used:
- Linear regression model
- KNN regression model
- Decision tree regression model
- Random forest regression model
- Xgboost regression model

# Insights:
- From this prediction both sellers and buyers check the importance of the features.
